# The Association Between Mobility Change and Mortality Rate in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic

The goal of this research is to analyze mobility change and mortality rates in the midst of the pandemic. The specific topics of interest include the mobility change for essential and nonessential places, how regions differ in mobility change and mortality rates, and whether there is an association between mobility change and mortality rate. 

## Project Motivation

These questions will help the audience understand whether there is a difference in people going to nonessential and essential places, how regions differ in mobility change and mortality rate, and whether there is an association between morality rate and mobility change. By beginning with the mobility change for essential and nonessential travel, the impact of coronavirus on society is established. Then, by breaking down mobility change and mortality rate into regions, differences in strictness of orders between regions may be highlighted. Finally, the study will determine whether there is a correlation between mobility change and mortality rate.

* How does COVID-19 affect the mobility of Grocery & Pharmacies and Retail & recreations of people from more populated areas? A paired t test for difference of means will be used to test this question. 

* Is there any difference in the mean motality rate of COVID-19 across the four regions of the United States? A ANOVA test for difference in means for mean positive cases in Midwest, Northeast, South, and West regions will be used.

* Are the regions and change in mobility rate independent of each other or not? A Chi-Square test for independence will be used to test the two variables.
  
* Is there association between mortality rate and mobility change? This question will be answered by regression analysis.

## Dependencies
* R/RStudio
* Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, broom, and reshape2
